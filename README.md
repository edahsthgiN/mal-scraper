This program has been created to export MyAnimeList data to excel spreadsheets.

It currently only supports individual, sequential text-based input but I hope to add the ability to use a file containing a list of usernames in the near future.

I am also working on adding a subset of the program (that will eventually become the main focus) that will append new user data to a single master spreadsheet.
This file would contain every anime added, and all relevant users' scores next to it (i.e. those that have scored the show)- this means that the data can be 
interpreted easier and faster.
